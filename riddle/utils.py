'''
* Randomly & coordinately splits two indexable items, in accordance with
  k-fold cross-validation parameters.
* Expects:
    - X = indexable item (typically list of samples)
    - y = indexable item (typically list of classes)
    - k_idx = the index of the partition to use
    - k = the # of partitions for k-fold cross-validation
* Returns:
    - duple representing the larger (k - 1)/k portion of split X, y data
    - duple representing the smaller 1/k portion of split X, y data
